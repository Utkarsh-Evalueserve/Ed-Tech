"""
Builds Parallel.ai search requests for a company.

Query design (updated after real runs kept missing genuine local/regional
articles -- German, Korean, Ukrainian, Mexican, Romanian, Cambodian,
Turkish, Brazilian and Qatari outlets covering a company's local activity,
none of which a handful of broad, shared-across-82-countries searches could
reliably surface):

  1. Official/press lane (1 call/company) -- the company's own newsroom/
     press/blog/investor pages, major press-release wires, AND a partner
     organization's own newsroom when the announcement is about a deal
     involving this company. English, global.
  2. Global/broad lane (1 call/company) -- catches internationally-picked-
     up or syndicated stories not tied to one specific tracked country
     (e.g. a US lawsuit reported by a German financial site).
  3. Per-geography lane (1 call per company PER tracked geography) -- the
     real fix for local/regional recall: a dedicated, country-specific
     search (local institutions, local partnerships, conferences, awards,
     accreditation) rather than one shared call across all 82 countries.

For a 280-company, 82-geography list this is ~280 x 84 = ~23,500 calls --
deliberately comprehensive rather than fast, per an explicit decision to
prioritize catching every article over runtime (see README for the time/
cost tradeoff and the knobs to dial it back down if needed).

Brand names/aliases are always kept as-is (never translated). Any
company-specific disambiguation guidance (the Notes column) is appended to
every objective below -- see _notes_clause.
