"""
Parallel.ai API client wrapper.

Uses the official `parallel-web` SDK (Parallel Search API). Wraps every call
with:
  - a bounded semaphore for concurrency control,
  - exponential backoff with jitter on rate limits/transient errors,
  - failed-query logging so a query that still fails after all retries is
    recorded (never silently dropped) and can be retried again at the end
    of the run.

NOTE: exact endpoint paths/response fields are provided by the SDK, which
insulates this integration from documentation changes. If you swap in a
different Parallel API surface, only this file needs to change.
